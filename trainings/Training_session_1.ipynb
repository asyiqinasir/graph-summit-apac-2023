    "This notebook allows you load a dataset based on an updated version of [Paysim](https://www.sisu.io/posts/paysim/).  \n",
    "PaySim is an approximation using an agent-based model and some anonymized, aggregate transactional data from a real mobile money network operator to create synthetic financial data sets academics and hackers can use for exploring ways to detect fraudulent behavior.  \n",

    "* CashIn: a client moves money into the network via a merchant\n",
    "* CashOut: a client moves money out of the network via a merchant\n",
    "* Debit: a client moves money into a bank\n",
